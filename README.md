#### MVP
- The company wants to be able to register / monitor vans. Important information for them to know is -
  - Name
  - Registration
  - Capacity (number of friends renter can have)
  - Type of vehicle - budget or luxury
  - Contact details for the renter
  
- Be able to assign vans to renters
- CRUD actions for vans / renters - remember the user - what would they want to see on each View? What Views should there be?:
    - view each van and upcoming renters for that van
    - view a renter's details & license
    - view all vans and which are available 

### Possible Extensions
- Mark renters as holding a license. Unlicensed renters won't be able to rent.
- Handle rental dates & availability
- Add 'budget' to renter to show them budget or luxury vans
- Let the company see all vans currently available 
- Sometimes vans are too old to rent - allow to enter the year of the vehicle and calculate the age. only vehicles under 10 years old can be rented out 
- Any extra functionality such as do renters need bedding, have they paid, total revenue made this year.
